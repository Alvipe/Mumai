    "The feature matrix that we have generated has 16 dimensions (eight features for each of the two EMG measurement channels). We could use this feature matrix to train our gesture classifier, but we can improve its performance by reducing the number of dimensions while keeping the relevant information. According to [3], there are two ways of performing this step: feature projection and feature selection. The latter method reduces the number of features by selecting the best subset of the original set, according to some criterion. In this case, we are going to implement the first method, which determines the best combination of the original features.\n",

PCA is usually used in unsupervised learning tasks and works by projecting data into a subspace by retaining those characteristics of the dataset that contribute most to its variance. On the other hand, LDA is used in supervised learning tasks and its objective is to find a data projection that maximizes the separation between classes. In this case, we are going to use LDA to reduce the dimensions of the feature matrix from 16 to 2.\n",

Depending on the employed machine learning algorithm, if the value of any of the features varies greatly, this feature can dominate over the rest and negatively influence the performance of the algorithm. For this reason, the range of all features is normalized so that each one contributes proportionately during training. To this end, the simplest method is rescaling the range of features to a new range of [0,1] or [-1,1] with the min-max algorithm.\n",
